A Simulation on Stack project demonstrating key operations like push, pop, peek, and traversal. It visualizes LIFO behavior with step-by-step execution, error handling, and clear output logs. Ideal for understanding stack mechanics and practicing core data structure concepts.
What is a Stack?
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last item inserted is the first to be removed.

Operations Implemented
Push (Insert)
Pop (Delete)
Peek (View top element)
Display (Show all elements)
Applications of Stack
Undo operations in editors
Function call stack (recursion)
Expression evaluation (postfix/prefix)
Checking balanced parentheses
Browser back/forward navigation
